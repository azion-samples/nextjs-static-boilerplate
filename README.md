# Next.js Static Boilerplate

The **Next.js Static Boilerplate** is designed to simplify and enhance the deployment process for Next.js Static.js applications directly on the edge of the network.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template, check the [How to deploy edge applications with the Next.js Static Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/nextjs-static-boilerplate/) guide.

This template uses Next.js version `14.1.4`.

## Static Exports

Next.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server. More details [Next Static Export](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).

### Supported Features
- Server Components
- Client Components
- Image Optimization
  - Image Optimization through next/image can be used with a static export by defining a custom image loader in next.config.js.
- Route Handlers
- Browser APIs

### Unsupported Features

Features that require a Node.js server, or dynamic logic that cannot be computed during the build process, are not supported:
- Dynamic Routes with dynamicParams: true
- Dynamic Routes without generateStaticParams()
- Route Handlers that rely on Request 
- Cookies
- Rewrites
- Redirects
- Headers
- Middleware
- Incremental Static Regeneration
- Image Optimization (with the default loader)
- Draft Mode

To successfully deploy this template, you must provide the information to configure your Azion application, as requested in the **Settings** tab on the template's page.

For a more detailed step-by-step on using this template and requirements, check the [How to deploy edge applications with the Next.js Static Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/nextjs-static-boilerplate/) guide for more details.

### Requirements

- Generate your [GitHub personal token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).
- Enable [Edge Functions](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/billing-and-subscriptions/) in your Azion account.

## Continuous deployment

Once the template is deployed, you can edit and update your args and code, as well as implement a continuous deployment workflow. However, you'll need first to *declare secrets on your project's GitHub repository* to complete the second build with the changes. When the second build is completed, you'll be able to manage your project with a continuous deployment workflow and edit the args as desired.

To do so, open your repository in GitHub. Then, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Action** to [add your variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), following these instructions:

1. Add the Azion personal token to the *secrets*:
- Read [how to generate an Azion personal token](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) in the documentation.

```bash
    AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN=<value>
```
2. Add the environments for use in the action workflow in the **main.yml** file, included in the **.github/workflows** folder of your repository:
```yml
  - name: edge-...
    id: azion_edge
    ...
    with:
        ....
        azionPersonalToken: ${{ secrets.AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
        ....
```
3. Open a pull request to merge the changes to the main branch and start the automatic deployment.

Now your project is ready to work with a continuous deployment workflow, updating instantly any changes in the application or the repository.

## Management

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/).

To manage and edit your edge applicationâ€™s settings, read the documentation about [managing edge applications](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it. Go to the [Domains](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/) documentation to read more about it.
